# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Prediction

Introduction

Cervical cancer is a significant health concern, with thousands of women affected annually. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to build a classifier that predicts the risk of cervical cancer in individuals. The dataset used contains information on 858 patients, including factors such as number of pregnancies, smoking habits, STD history, demographics, and medical records.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to utilize Python libraries and machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for cervical cancer risk assessment. Through exploratory data analysis and model training, we aim to understand the underlying patterns in the data and build an effective classifier.


Learning Objectives
•	Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset

•	Perform exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and relationships.

•	Split and standardize training and testing dataset.

•	Train the XGBoost model using Scikit-Learn.

•	Evaluate and analyze the performance of classifier models.
